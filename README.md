# Read Time Estimation (RTE)
RTE is a program that helps estimate how long it will take to read user-chosen books based on individual reading speed.

------------
## Features:
- **Determine the reading speed** by providing a short randomized paragraph to read.
- **Add any desired books** - simply input the name and page count or word count.
- **Compare your reading speed** with the global averages.
- **Two languages** are fully supported with the help of localization files for the UI and testing paragraphs.
